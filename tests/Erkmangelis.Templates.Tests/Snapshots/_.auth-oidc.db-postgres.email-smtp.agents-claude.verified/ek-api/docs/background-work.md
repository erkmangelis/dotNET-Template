# Background work

## Repeating work inside the app

For small housekeeping that every instance may do on its own, derive from `ScopedBackgroundLoop`
(`src/Acme.Notes.Api/Infrastructure/Jobs/ScopedBackgroundLoop.cs`). `IdempotencyCleanup`, which
deletes expired idempotency keys every hour, is the example:

```csharp
internal sealed class ExpiredRowsCleanup(IServiceScopeFactory scopes, TimeProvider time, ILogger<ExpiredRowsCleanup> logger)
    : ScopedBackgroundLoop(scopes, time, logger)
{
    protected override string Name => "expired-rows-cleanup";

    protected override TimeSpan Interval => TimeSpan.FromMinutes(15);

    protected override Task RunOnceAsync(IServiceProvider services, CancellationToken cancellationToken) =>
        services.GetRequiredService<IExpiredRows>().DeleteAsync(cancellationToken);
}
```

Register it with `services.AddHostedService<ExpiredRowsCleanup>()`. The loop:

- runs once at startup, then every `Interval`, timed by the injected `TimeProvider` so tests can move time;
- gives each run its own dependency injection scope, so scoped services such as the database context
  are fresh and disposed after the run;
- logs a failed run and tries again on the next tick, instead of stopping the app;
- cancels the run in progress when the app shuts down (within `Api:ShutdownTimeoutSeconds`).

Every instance of the app runs its own loop, and nothing remembers a run across restarts. Keep the work
safe to repeat.
